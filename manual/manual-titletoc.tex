LaTeX3 programming layer (\textsf{expl3}) is very powerful for advanced users,
but it is a little complicated for normal users.
This \textcolor{green3}{\sffamily functional} package aims to provide
intuitive LaTeX2 functional interfaces for it.
\par\vspace{0.5em}
Although there are functions in LaTeX3, the evaluation of them is from outside to inside.
With this package, the evaluation of functions is from inside to outside,
which is the same as other programming languages such as \texttt{JavaScript} or \texttt{Lua}.
In this way, it is rather easy to debug code too.

Note that many paragraphs in this manual are copied from the documentation of \textsf{expl3}.
